Web catalog is a content management tool that helps build highly personalized custom versions of your websites by mixing in category pages, product pages, landing pages and pre-existing system pages in different variations based on the customer account information, their customer group or language preference.

With OroCommerce web catalog and content tree, you can organize the target web site structure to gain improved purchasing experience and use a set of in-place SEO tools to make it reachable for your target audience.

The Web Catalog content nodes may be of the following types:

* System page - one of the standard eCommerce website pages (e.g. sign in, user profile, open orders, etc). 
* Landing page - a custom `landing page <./marketing-landing-page>`_ created in the **Marketing > Landing Pages** section.
* Category - a category of the `master catalog <./products/master-catalog>`_.
* Product - direct link to `product <./products/products>`_ details.
