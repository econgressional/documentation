Tax Management Overview
=======================

.. begin

An international B2B selling business has certain international tax obligations, like a sales tax in the U.S. and Value Added Tax (VAT) in EU and other countries. In addition to that, some products are tax-free or have lower tax rates and some of your customers may be eligible for tax exemption.

Tax management in OroCommerce helps you ensure compliance with the tax rules and regulations in global B2B online sales. With built in tax rules and tax reports you get timely and precise information for your sales tax, goods and services tax, or value added tax payment. You may inform your buyer about the volume of tax included into their order or quote, or may include the tax in the product price they see placing an order.

The following sections provide information and guidance on the following topics:

* Setting up tax rules that define the tax rate applied for a product group sold to a group of customers with similar tax obligations. The tax rate depends both on the tax jurisdiction, the tax status of your customers and the tax status of the products you are selling. When your customer files a purchase order, OroCommerce automatically picks the necessary tax rate and calculates the tax amount to be covered by your customer in this purchase order.

* Managing tax exemption: enabling zero tax rates in certain jurisdictions for the selected product categories (e.g. medical products) or customers (e.g. schools, hospitals, government organizations).

* Controlling digital product taxes. Some states in USA and the EU have special rules for taxing digital products. OroCommerce takes those regulations into account and enforces destination-based taxation when the buyer's location is in EU or in the state with no digital product tax in USA. OroCommerce distinguishes purchases of digital products by the product tax code. All digital items should be labeled with a special tax code for digital products. Moreover, all these tax codes should be listed in EU VAT Tax and US Sales Tax configuration, to launch special tax calculation rules.
