In OroCommerce terminology, customers are companies who buy your products using OroCommerce store frontend.

Customer users act on behalf of the company and may have a limited set of permissions in OroCommerce, depending on their function in the customer organization. You can manage customer users and roles in the OroCommerce administration interface (see `Managing Customer Users <../customers/customer-users>`_ and `Managing Customer Roles <../customers/customer-user-roles>`_ for more information), or you can delegate this function to the customer who will access user and role management in the OroCommmerce front store (see `Delegating Users and Role Management to the Customer <../customers/delegate>`_ for more information).

You can assign dedicated sales representatives to support the company purchase process. They can `assign custom price lists <../pricing>`_ that are visible to a customer user on the OroCommerce web front instead of the standard prices enabled generally. Assigned sales people can assist with requests for quote, quotes, and orders made by customer users. Sales people can `add notes <../getting-started/common-actions/add-notes>`_ and `attachments <../getting-started/common-actions/add-attachments>`_ to share additional information about the customer, their needs or any related information.

You can set specific payment terms that match the payment terms agreement with the company, and label a customer with a tax code that impacts the method of tax calculation in the customer order (e.g. a special tax code should be used for tax-exempt companies, to discard any tax during the checkout). For more information, please see `Managing Customers <../customers/customers>`_ section.

When several divisions of a company are using OroCommerce, you can organize them into the two-level organization structure using the parent customer option. Parent company aggregates information from its children, which may be convenient for monitoring and controlling divisions activities. For more information, please see `Managing Customer Hierarchy <../customers/customers/organize>`_ section.

Companies may be organized into groups to simplify sharing configuration, payment and tax-related settings, and price lists among multiple customers, for example those with the same service level. See `Managing Customer Groups <../customers/customer-groups>`_ for more information.
